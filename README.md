# Unit Testing Task

Practical Task for Unit Tests using NUnit framework.

## Task Description

Modify the application from the first task of the Basic of .NET framework and C # by separating the functionality of counting the maximum number of unequal consecutive characters in a string into a separate method.
Extend functionality by adding two more methods:

1. determining the maximum number of consecutive identical letters of the Latin alphabet in a line
2. determining the maximum number of consecutive identical digits

For each method, write Unit Tests (use the NUnit, XUnit or MSTest framework is your choice; follow AAA and FIRST). When creating tests, pay special attention to equivalence classes.

 ## Task Implementation

 The "CountingStringChars" project has been modified by adding the "GetConsecutIdentLatinCount" and "GetConsecutIdentDigitsCount" methods to the ForMethods.cs file.
 
 Unit Tests using NUnit framework for these methods have been added to the ForMethodsTests.cs file.
 
 All functionality is implemented
